# Prefixer
Prefixer is a modern tool for managing [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) [Proton](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton) prefixes, seeking to replace [protontricks](https://github.com/Matoking/protontricks) with a friendlier interface, faster responses and modular approach.

# Usage
Writing a full usage guide isn't very simple or necessary, run `prefixer --help` and it should explain everything. The tool is made as intuitively as I could build it and should be self-explanatory.

# Installation
The official way of downloading Prefixer is from the AUR under the package name `prefixer`. This approach only works on Arch Linux. If you use another distro, you are free to build the Python wheel yourself, but Arch is the primary distribution for Prefixer and is prioritized.
